0,23554873,"Conversely, cohorts selected on the basis of pronounced phenotypes may be difficult to recruit, a potential problem not only for variant discovery but also for replication, especially where the discovery cohort includes individuals not normally recruited to other cohorts (e.g. those with DD).

0,23554873,"As a minimum, therefore, it is essential to include appropriate geographically-matched controls (as was the case in the original reports that are the subject of our replication study). ",0.53,0,0

",0.62,0,0
1,23554873,"One approach, analogous to methods such as the ‘cohort allelic sums test’ [38] developed for analysis of multiple rare sequence variants within a gene, is to treat a set of overlapping GSVs as functionally identical, effectively discounting the structural complexity, so that only a single hypothesis related to a putative functional effect is tested. ",0.63,0,0
0,23554873,"Although perhaps appropriate where, for instance, all variants are predicted to have similar functional consequences due to directly disrupting or deleting a particular gene or due to affecting an intergenic region, this approach requires user intervention and is not universally applicable (e.g. in the context of a genome-wide analysis).

0,23554873,"A more general unsupervised approach for analysis of such complex loci, used in the studies examined here [citation] and also in analyses of common GSVs [36], [37], [39], is to test separately at multiple probe locations within a region. ",0.67,1,0
0,23554873,"However, as illustrated by our analysis of the FOXP2 locus, it cannot be assumed that overlapping but distinct variants have similar effect sizes or even directions; furthermore, such ‘point-wise’ analysis entails multiple statistical tests at each GSV locus, leading to potential inflation in the reported P-value for the region as a whole.

",0.82,0,0
0,23554873,"Although attempts were made to take account of multiple testing (e.g. exclude GSVs present in the Database of Genomic Variants, including only rare GSVs, empirical estimate of FDR), it is unclear to what extent these methods are effective – methods developed for association analysis of rare sequence variants are not consistently well-powered even for large sample sizes [42].
